1-1) What are the values of Maiar and Hobbit that you have? Is there a discrepancy? Explain your answer.
The values I do have is 'Frodo', and 'Sauron', there is not two seperate values for the keys due to the hashmap only accepting one key for each value.
1-2) What is the capacity of your hash table after you have hashed all the above items? Explain your answer.
The capacity is at 24 because we went over the initial capacity of 8 and the hashmap resized by multipling that initial capacity by the size_ratio of 3.
